# Gossip Girl (2007)
This is my take on the Gossip Girl website from the original 2007 series. My partner and I have been watching the show recently and at the start of every episode there is a snapshot of the hot goss on the front page of the site. After about a season I started thinking to myself "I wonder if this site exists in real life....". It doesnt. So I made it. Enjoy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this page from scratch using HTML and CSS. I based it off of the Gossip Girl website from the original 2007 show.

## Optimizations

I am working to make this site more responsive with better looking modals.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first big project using CSS transforms and animations. It was a lot of fun and I very pleased with the outcome!
